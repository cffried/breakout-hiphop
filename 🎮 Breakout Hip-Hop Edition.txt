üéÆ Breakout: Hip-Hop Edition (Working Title)
============================================

A classic block-breaking game with a foundation that can evolve into a roguelike RPG 
with a hip-hop soundtrack and urban 2.5D vibes.

---

‚úÖ Gotta-Haves (MVP)
--------------------
1. Core Mechanics
   - Paddle controlled by player (keyboard or mouse)
   - Ball physics (bounce on walls, paddle, and bricks)
   - Bricks with different hit counts (some require multiple hits)
   - Lose condition: ball hits the ground
   - Win condition: all bricks are destroyed

2. Game Feel
   - Classic arcade physics & visuals
   - Smooth paddle and ball movement
   - Simple start and restart screens

---

üé® Visual/Audio (Initial)
-------------------------
- Graphics: Simple retro blocks and paddle (use Pygame surfaces)
- Audio: Placeholder sound effects; later integrate custom hip-hop tracks

---

‚ú® Nice-to-Haves (Future Expansion)
-----------------------------------
- Procedural level generation (roguelike vibe)
- RPG elements (player stats, power-ups, progression)
- Boss fights and secret rooms
- 2.5D urban art style with animations
- Full custom hip-hop soundtrack

---

üõ† Technical Stack
------------------
- Python (main language)
- Pygame (for rendering, input, collision detection, sound)
- Modular, OOP design to make expansions easy

---

üéØ Learning Goals
-----------------
- Strengthen game loop & event handling
- Explore Pygame conventions & game structure
- Expand beyond OOP (maybe ECS or procedural generation patterns later)

---

‚è≥ Timeline
-----------
- Week 1: Build a playable MVP (paddle, ball, bricks, win/lose)
- Future weeks: Layer in power-ups, levels, procedural content, soundtrack

---

‚úÖ Next Steps
-------------
1. Decide Framework ‚Üí Confirm Pygame
2. Set up Environment ‚Üí Install Pygame and create a minimal window
3. Basic Game Loop ‚Üí Empty loop with quit handling and frame rate control
4. Draw Paddle & Ball ‚Üí Render and move with input
5. Collision Detection ‚Üí Ball bounces off paddle/walls and destroys bricks
